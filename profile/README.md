**Turn Off The Voice Saying You Can’t Switch Your Career To AI.**

Learn How to BRIDGE Your Career To AI. We'll hold you by the hand to prove to yourself that you can switch your career to AI.

**Secret #1**: The quickest way to switch to AI is REVERSE LEARNING:​ Stop learning AI, learn the AI that is useful for companies TODAY.

**Secret #2**: The quickest way to switch to AI is PRACTICAL LEARNING: Creating an useful AI project is EASIER than you think.

**Secret #3**: The quickest way to switch to AI is FOLLOW A GUIDE:​ ​Get mentorship from a person who is where YOU WANT TO BE.

Here's what most people don't get:

* Companies don't care about AI, companies care about useful AI. For a company it is irrelevant if you have a MSc or PhD in AI. They only care if YOU CAN GENERATE money with AI.
* The way people teach AI is wrong. Most AI courses are great if you want to be an AI professor at University. They teach the theory of AI. If you want to switch your career to AI, you need to focus on USEFUL AI, the type of AI that generates money for companies.
* The Bridge To AI challenge helps professionals working in other fields get the CONFIDENCE they need to switch their careers to AI.
* The Bridge To AI Challenge IS NOT about learning theory you'll never use in real life, IS NOT about spending a ton of money on another AI course, and IS NOT a training where you're left all alone to "figure it out".
